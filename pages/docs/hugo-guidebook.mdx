## Anthropology Museum

This is the best way to start your journey in Mexico City. It's the best way to understand Mexican culture.

## Teotihuacan

The best way to explore the surroundings of Mexico City is always with locals, so the recommendation is to do a tour there. In this experience Hugo (me!) & Gabriel, two enthusiasts in Anthropology & Pulque producers, will take you to explore the ruins. At the end they’ll invite them to their grandma's house to have the most delicious homemade mole.

## Museo de Templo Mayor

In the heart of Mexico City you can find the remains of Tenochtitlan the great Mexica (Aztec) City. My recommendation is to visit this place after visiting Teotihuacan and the anthropology museum (also you can buy the tickets in advance)

## Museum of Fine Arts

Just next to one of the most emblematic parks in Mexico (Alameda Central) you can find this gorgeous museum with murals of Diego Rivera, Rufino Tamayo, Clemente Orozco, etc. You can also buy the tickets online. I recommend you to visit this place while you’re visiting Centro Historico.
