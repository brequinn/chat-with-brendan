# About Me

I've been working in product management for over 11 years. I started my career in consulting at Accenture in Spain, then moved to Berlin to work for a startup as a product manager. Afterwards, I moved back to the US to work in the mobility space at Zipcar, followed by InVision, a design collaboration SaaS platform.

I took a shot at entrepreneurship, leaving InVision to start my own ed-tech company. I later joined Teespring as a senior PM focused on their creator platform and products, and lastly, I joined Etsy as a staff product manager focused on the experience for international sellers.

I was laid off in December last year, and after taking a few months of parental leave, I am now searching for a full-time role.
