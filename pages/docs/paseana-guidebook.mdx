## Pulquería Las Duelistas

One of the coolest Pulquerías in town. Here you'll be able to try a variety of flavors, while taking in the mixed crowd of people and loud tunes playing in the background. If you don't like crowded places, go as early as possible, because it gets pretty packed in the later afternoon.

## Cantina El Centenario

This place has been kicking since 1945. If you're wanting to try a true Cantina experience, this place is perfect and the benefit is that it's located right in the heart of Condesa, so you can always choose to move on to other nearby bars.

## Pulqueria Temple of Diana

Located in the heart of Xochimilco, this is a traditional pulquería that has been around for over 4 generations. The special thing about this place is that they have taken pulque to a new level by creating unique flavors like cempasúchil (marigold flower) and mint, to name a couple. I recommend visiting this place during the day only.

# Historical Cantinas

## Salon Tenampa

Interested in Tequila and Mariachis? Head on over to Salón Tenampa! It is in the famous Plaza Garibaldi, where you’ll find multiple Mariachi groups playing out in the open. Once inside Tenampa, be sure to order some tequila and get ready to sing mariachi songs with the rest of the restaurant. \*Be careful getting in and out of Plaza Garibaldi, while it is safe there, the surrounding area isn’t as nice, so it is best to order an uber to get to and from there, instead of walking, especially at night.

## La Opera

Cantina La Opera is a living piece of Mexico City's history. What I love most is the sense of timelessness – you feel like you've stepped back into an era when revolutionary tales were shared over tequila. The walls are adorned with historical memorabilia, and the atmosphere is charged with the stories of political figures who once frequented this iconic spot. It is said that Pancho Villa shot his gun into the ceiling and the bullet hole is marked to this day!

## La Faena

Cantina La Faena is a traditional cantina in downtown Mexico City. It’s walls are decorated with Bull-fighting memorabilia. A juke-box plays classic mexican and latin songs. Sit down, order a drink and you’ll also get “botana” (snacks) brought to you to enjoy while you enjoy drinks with friends.

# Dancing

## Patrick Miller [dancing]

One of the most iconic places in Mexico City when it comes to nightclubs (if you can properly call it that?). Patrick Miller is an old storage facility that was converted into a dance bar in the 80's! If you're ok with being in big crowds, this place is a must-do when in the city on a Friday night. Envision Hi-NRG music pumping out loudly, while lazer lights flash back and forth across the rooms while big circles of dance-offs perform. Dress code? Anything goes! And you'll literally be in for a surprise when you see some of the "interesting attires" showcased. Type of crowd? All walks of life enter this place. Do not expect anything fancy. Get ready to sweat your butt off, but you can refresh yourself from time to time by hiding out along the sidelines of the main dance area with a beer, which is the only alcohol served in this joint.

## Mama Rumba [dancing]

If you're into salsa dancing, go here! This place offers dance lessons earlier in the evening and then once the nights gets going, it fills with a mix of salsa amateurs and professionals out to have a good time. Often, there's a live band playing.

## Panadería Rosetta

If you're a baked-goods lover like me, you have to check out this place. Mexican Chef, Elena Reygada, does a wonderful job at blending the art of French pastries with traditional Mexican sweet breads. My personal favorite is her Rosemary bun (bollitos de romero). Also good are her guava or ricotta and chocolate rolls. Truth is, you can't really go wrong with anything you order!

## Churrería El Moro Parque México

This famous "churro" chain is a must-do when visiting Mexico City. My favorite location is the one by parque Mexico, where you can have a seat at one of their outdoor tables to people-watch or grab your items to go and head over to the park to hang out with the rest of the city-wanderers. Don't miss out on trying the "Consuelo" an exquisite ice-cream, churro sandwich. You can also order a mini-consuelo which includes three small sandwiches with your choice of different ice-cream fillings.

## Páramo

Great place to grab drinks and a bite to eat at night, offering a cool, lively atmosphere.

## Pasillo de Humo

If you're not planning to make a stop in Oaxaca, this place is a great option to try authentic Oaxacan flavors. Chef Alam Mendez's menu was inspired by his parent's own restaurant in Oaxaca, Las Quince Letras, where he spent a good portion of his childhood.

## Máximo Bistrot

Celebrated Chef Eduardo García focuses on fresh, sustainable, local products, delivering a creative menu which beautifully blends traditional and modern Mexican cuisine.

## Expendio de Maiz Sin Nombre

One of my personal favorites, this small little venue shares my passion for native Mexican corn, offering a series of small courses (1 antojito per course, there are usually about 6 courses served), which you can choose to opt out of at any point. The food here is simple, unpretentious, but hearty and homey. If they have it on hand, try their Kombucha or their Tejuino (a fermented beverage from Guadalajara).

## Masala y Maíz

If you love both Indian and Mexican food, need I say more? This spot is the perfect fusion of both. Yum yum!!!

## Molino Pujol: la tortillería gourmet

If you didn't get the chance to visit Enrique Olvera's famous "Pujol" treat yourself to one of his corn specialties at his quaint little tortillería, located in the heart of Condesa neighborhood.
