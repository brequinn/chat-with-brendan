# How much product management experience do you have?

I've worked in product management for 12 years, starting my career at Accenture in Spain before moving to Berlin to work for a startup. I then returned to the US, working in the mobility space at Zipcar and the design collaboration platform InVision. After a brief entrepreneurial stint with my own ed-tech company, I joined Teespring as a senior PM focusing on their creator platform. Most recently, I was a staff product manager at Etsy, where I concentrated on enhancing the experience for international sellers until I was laid off in December. Following a few months of parental leave, I am now actively seeking a new full-time product management position that aligns with my skills and experience.

I want to work on a product I'm passionate about, where I can make a significant impact. I'm attracted to companies that prioritize tech innovation and design, especially those leveraging AI. I'm looking for a role that utilizes my technical skills while allowing me to grow my interest in engineering.

At Zipcar, I launched their flexible car sharing service in London, fundamentally changing urban mobility in one of the world's largest cities.
