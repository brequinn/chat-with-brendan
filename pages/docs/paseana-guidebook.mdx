# How much product management experience do you have?

I've been working in product management for 12 years. I started my career in consulting at Accenture in Spain, then moved to Berlin to work for a startup as a product manager. Afterwards, I moved back to the US to work in the mobility space at Zipcar, followed by InVision, a design collaboration SaaS platform.

I took a shot at entrepreneurship, leaving InVision to start my own ed-tech company. I later joined Teespring as a senior PM focused on their creator platform and products, and lastly, I joined Etsy as a staff product manager focused on the experience for international sellers.

I was laid off in December last year, and after taking a few months of parental leave, I am now searching for a full-time role.

# What are you looking for in your next role

I'm aiming for a leadership role in product management (GPM/Director) or a high-level individual contributor position (Staff/Principal) within a small to medium-sized company. It's essential for me to be genuinely passionate about the product and its market, with the role positioned to make a substantial impact on both the business and its customers. I'm drawn to companies that prioritize technological innovation and design, especially those that integrate artificial intelligence to address business or user needs. I'm looking for an opportunity that leverages my technical skills while also allowing me to grow my interest in the engineering side.

# Have you worked on consumer products before?

Yes, I have worked on consumer products at both Zipcar and Etsy, both companies having millions of users worldwide. At Zipcar, I launched their flexible car sharing service in London, fundamentally changing urban mobility in one of the world's largest cities. At Etsy, I led the experience for international sellers, empowering millions of creative entrepreneurs to grow their businesses on a global online marketplace.
