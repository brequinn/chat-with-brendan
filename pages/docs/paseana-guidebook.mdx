# Tell me about yourself

Sure, I've been working in product management for over 11 years.

I started my career in consulting at Accenture in Spain, which gave me insight into working cultures and launching products in different markets.

Then, I moved to Berlin to work for a startup as a product manager, developing a location-based mobile advertising app for large retailers in Europe and the US.

Afterwards, I moved back to the US to work in the mobility space at Zipcar. I helped launch Zipcar's flexible per-minute car-sharing model in Brussels and London. I was then promoted to oversee the entire iOS and Android product experience for all of Zipcar's 2 million users.

After Zipcar, I joined InVision, a design collaboration SaaS platform. As the mobile PM, I successfully introduced a new strategy focused on collaborating with non-designer personas, achieving strong user growth for InVision and signing large contracts with companies such as Nike, Google, and Uber.

I took a shot at entrepreneurship, leaving InVision to start my own ed-tech company focused on building an educational gaming app for pre-K children in LATAM. During COVID, I reached 40,000 downloads and 2,000 WAUs. After failing to secure a technical co-founder and funding, I decided to return to a full-time role.

I joined Teespring as a senior PM focused on their creator platform and products. I worked on helping influencers across TikTok, Twitch, and Instagram further monetize their audiences by setting up their e-commerce stores with products of their choosing. I worked on TikTok's first "shop" integration with Teespring, which was TikTok's first commerce capability for the creators on its platform.

Lastly, I joined Etsy as a staff product manager focused on the experience for international sellers. I worked on the seller onboarding experience in our core markets outside the US to drive inventory and seller growth and help Etsy expand internationally. I also worked on pricing tools for sellers to help with their pricing strategies for different markets (again for sellers outside the US). Additionally, I partnered with Google's Vortex AI team to explore ways to integrate GenAI into the seller experience to streamline core business management tasks.

I was laid off in December last year, and after taking a few months of parental leave, I am now searching for a full-time role.
